Simple Task Tracker
A minimalist web-based task tracker designed to help you keep track of your daily to-do items. Add new tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them when they're done. Your tasks are saved locally in your browser, so they'll be there even if you close the tab!

‚ú® Features
Add Tasks: Easily add new tasks using the input field and "Add Task" button, or by pressing Enter.

Mark as Complete: Click the checkmark (‚úî) button next to a task to toggle its completion status. Completed tasks are visually struck through.

Delete Tasks: Remove tasks you no longer need by clicking the cross (‚úñ) button.

Persistence: Tasks are automatically saved to your browser's Local Storage, meaning your list will remain intact even if you close and reopen the browser.

Responsive Design: Basic styling ensures a decent appearance on various screen sizes.
